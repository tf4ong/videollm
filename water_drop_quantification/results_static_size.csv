There are a total of 4 droplets.

The smallest droplet is the topmost one.

*   The second droplet from the top is approximately 1.7× the area of the smallest droplet.
*   The third droplet from the top is approximately 4.0× the area of the smallest droplet.
*   The bottommost droplet is approximately 7.5× the area of the smallest droplet.
