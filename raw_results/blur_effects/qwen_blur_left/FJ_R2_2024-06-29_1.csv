Justification: The mouse successfully retrieved the water drop using its right paw, bringing it close to its mouth. The tongue made contact with the drop, and the mouse consumed a significant portion of the water. However, some water was spilled during the retrieval process, and not all of the drop was consumed. The amount consumed appears to be substantial but not complete, placing it between 50% and 70%.","1. Yes
