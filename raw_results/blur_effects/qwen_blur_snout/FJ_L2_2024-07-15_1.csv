Justification: The mouse successfully retrieved the water drop using its right paw, bringing it close to its mouth. The tongue made contact with the water, and the mouse consumed a significant portion of the drop. However, some water was spilled during the retrieval process, indicating that not all of the water was consumed. The amount consumed appears to be more than 50% but less than 70%, fitting the ""Partial Success"" category.","1. No
